        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pairing is often associated with programming. There&#39;s a Wikipedia article about pair programming, but nothing on pairing in general. And yet, it&#39;s a fantastic technique for getting anything done well, especially when neither of you really know exactly how to approach a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

You just need another person that is keen to meet regularly and a public space like a coffee shop or a quiet pub. That&#39;s it. You already have your community going. Everything else that follows in this blog post are just things that helped us to grow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://londonswcraft.com&quot;&gt;London Software Craftsmanship Community&lt;/a&gt; (LSCC) from two people to the largest software craftsmanship community in the world, but they are not essential to have a great and healthy community.&lt;/p&gt;

Brazilian, same age as me, and moved to the UK on the same year I did.
As we were talking about music, I mentioned I like punk rock. He said he
likes punk rock as well, but as a musician, he listens to a bit of
everything. The conversation was going well until he asked me what my
favourite bands were. &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legi%C3%A3o_Urbana&quot;&gt;Legiao
Urbana&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is my
favourite Brazilian band I said. &quot;Seriously?&quot; he said with a puzzled
face. &quot;They are rubbish, man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

The problem was not the fact that I read slow but that I only had one style of reading irrespective of what I was reading and why.&lt;/p&gt;

Some time projects require a very fast ramp up with a much larger set of teams where achieving a good balance of talent/skills is not possible and the experience is a commodity. Several large projects I have been involved with in the past have had to make this compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

Having said that the online documentation can definitely do with some improvement.  The following is a quick example of of how you may execute an XQuery that takes multiple XML documents as input.
