        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On 4th of March 2014, a few days before my baby boy Samuel completed two months, a well-regarded cardiologist—let&#39;s call him &lt;em&gt;Dr. Smith&lt;/em&gt;—gave us the news that Samuel had a heart condition called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_valve_stenosis&quot;&gt;pulmonary valve stenosis&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Smith&#39;s recommendation was that Samuel had a heart procedure called &lt;a href=&quot;http://tchin.org/resource_room/c_art_02.htm&quot;&gt;balloon pulmonary valvotomy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://tchin.org/resource_room/c_art_02.htm&quot;&gt;ballon valvuloplasty&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible. The procedure was scheduled to 11th of March 2014, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://theharleystreetclinic.co.uk/&quot;&gt;The Harley Street Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Needless to say, the whole family was devastated.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a wonderful 19-month journey came to an end. I released the last chapter of my book &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanpub.com/socra&quot;&gt;Software Craftsmanship: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride&lt;/a&gt;. As an avid reader since a young age, writing a book was always something I wanted to do. For me, it didn&#39;t matter if people would read it or not; I just wanted to write a book I was proud of. I wanted to write a book that would help developers and companies to get better. A book that could inspire developers to care about their craft. I also wanted a book that my kids, at some point in the future, could read and be inspired, even if they had chosen different professions. I&#39;m not sure if they will read it or be inspired by it, but at least I&#39;m giving my best shot.&lt;/p&gt;

And yet, it&#39;s a fantastic technique for getting anything done well, especially when neither of you really know exactly how to approach a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

You just need another person that is keen to meet regularly and a public space like a coffee shop or a quiet pub. That&#39;s it. You already have your community going. Everything else that follows in this blog post are just things that helped us to grow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://londonswcraft.com&quot;&gt;London Software Craftsmanship Community&lt;/a&gt; (LSCC) from two people to the largest software craftsmanship community in the world, but they are not essential to have a great and healthy community.&lt;/p&gt;

Brazilian, same age as me, and moved to the UK on the same year I did.
As we were talking about music, I mentioned I like punk rock. He said he
likes punk rock as well, but as a musician, he listens to a bit of
everything. The conversation was going well until he asked me what my
favourite bands were. &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legi%C3%A3o_Urbana&quot;&gt;Legiao
Urbana&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is my
favourite Brazilian band I said. &quot;Seriously?&quot; he said with a puzzled
face. &quot;They are rubbish, man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

The problem was not the fact that I read slow but that I only had one style of reading irrespective of what I was reading and why.&lt;/p&gt;

Several large projects I have been involved with in the past have had to make this compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
